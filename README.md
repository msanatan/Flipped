## Development

The easiest way to compile Arduboy games, or other Arduino code, is with the [Arduino IDE](https://arduboy.com/download-and-learn-arduino/). Follow these instructions on setting up [Arduino IDE to work with Arduboy](https://arduboy.com/download-and-learn-arduino/).

If you don't have an Arduino device connected to your machine, you need to *verify* the `.ino` file to compile all C++ code into a `.hex` file. You can then load the `.hex` file into your emulator/simulator like [Project ABE](https://felipemanga.github.io/ProjectABE/).

The Arduino IDE is very limited, I prefer to use VS Code with the Arduino extension. You do need the Arduino libraries installed to make it work, easiest way to get them is by installing the Arduino IDE. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) apparently works well for Arduino development.
